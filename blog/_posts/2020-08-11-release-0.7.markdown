Seems it's a significantly large update.
Not sure whether this is a good idea.
But you all know, we live in covid times, and all plans were scrambled.

## New features

* Open another file in the same window.
  A simple but missing feature that was implemented even without a ticket.
  Simply press `o` button to use it!
* Restore [export][issue94] into `.dot` format.
  Sometimes you may need to export your graph into an image to show it to other people.
  Just use following procedure:

```
$ sieben-manage dot my_file.db > output.dot
$ dot -Tpng -o graph.png output.dot
```

## Bug fixes

* Zoom: [inconsistent behavior when close zoom root][issue98]
* Improve [tests stability][issue92]
* Migration: drop empty table 'new_edges' (crap left after [previous migration][issue16])

## Refactoring

* [Replace Graph methods with commands][issue97] (reduce coupling between classes)
* [Extract common interface to the Goals class][issue68] (reduce coupling between implementations)
* [Toggle views independently from each other][issue67] (inner preparations for a feature)

## Compatibility breaks

* Do *not* open `sieben.db` file by default when called without argument.
  This "feature" exists from the very first version of application, but now it's not actually used anymore.
* Use f-strings (no more Python3.5)

## Other improvements

Various improvements in development process.

* Move from requirements.txt to Pipenv
* Update dependencies: PyQt5, Hypothesis, Pytest, Mypy, Pylint
* Add Black for formatting
* Fix some Mypy warnings

## Plans for version 0.8

Well, not much yet.
Look for issues and commits to stay in touch.
