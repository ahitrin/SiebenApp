# 4. Document old decisions

Date: 2020-08-16

## Status

Accepted

Implemented in [5. Forever alpha version](0005-forever-alpha-version.md)

## Context

I've started to use ADR in 2017, but declined after a while.
Nevertheless a lot of important decisions were made since that.
Without proper explanations they surely will be unclear to the fellow reader.

## Decision

Write down the most significant architecture decisions that were made in the project.

## Consequences

Some aspects of project development process should become more clear for others.

An unknown part of my spare time will be spent on documenting instead of coding.
