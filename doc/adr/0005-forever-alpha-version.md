# 5. Forever alpha version

Date: 2020-08-16 (actually, around 2018-2019)

## Status

Accepted

Implements [4. Document old decisions](0004-document-old-decisions.md)

## Context

SiebenApp is my pet project.
After 3 years being public it has 12 stars (including my own), 0 fresh forks and 0 others contributors (not counting bots).

An amount of time I could spend on the project is highly limited.
Having more users means spending more time on supporting.

## Decision

Instead of making project more appeal for others I'd prefer to make it more useful for myself (since I use it regularly).
This means:

* Do not work on features I don't actually need (like #1).
* Drop implemented features I use rarely.
* Do not support compliance with old Python versions.
* Do not waste time on project advertising.

This decision **should** be rejected in case there appear more users of the project.
Until it happens, please consider the application to be in "Alpha" version (e.g. used by the developer only).

## Consequences

* A number of projects stars/contributors/forks will grow very slow.
* My spare time will be spent more consciously.
* My motivation to work on the project will be higher.
* Feature cuts will speed up project development.
