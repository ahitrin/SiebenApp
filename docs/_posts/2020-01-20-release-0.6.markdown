A fast after-release following 0.5/0.5.1, with few important changes.

## New Features

None detected

## Bug fixes

 - [Previous selection may get lost on unzoom][issue85].
   A bug found by property tests (at last!) was the main reason to schedule this release.

## Compatibility breaks

 - [Remove support for Python 3.5][issue64].
   A main reason why the new version is numbered with 0.6, not 0.5.2.
   I hope there is no big need in supporting this quite old Python version because all major distros already have new ones.
   When targeting Python 3.6+ we could use much prettier code syntax like f-strings and type annotations.

## Other interesting improvements

 - [Extract common interface for Goal class][issue68].
   Refactoring in progress.
   It provides better support for PyCharm and Mypy.
   The code is still not ready for static type checking, but our wagon is rolling...

## Plans for version 0.7

 - [CLI mode][issue65]. It's funny! Enough to say!
 - [Save actions history][issue66].
   Sometimes I feel it would be nice to have some kind of recorded history.
   For example, it simplifies undoing or allows to recognize "what a crap this cat was made by walking on my keyboard".
 - [Toggle views independently from each other][issue67].
   Circular toggle between view modes was one of the first features.
   It was made quick&dirty and now looks like a 5th wheel.
   I'll try to replace it with more "classical" approach: separate on/off toggle for each view aspect.

Of course, plans could change, you know.
